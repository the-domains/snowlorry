# Snowlorry

Music - young and old, fast and slow, sad and happy, complete and in progress.

## Experiment

You have to start somewhere and end somewhere and what you do in the middle determines what you are.

Fay Wray

Swirl

Bandit Queen

Darkhorse

Mecto

Comrade

The Devil in Miss Jones

Linkcloud

Snowlorry

That's the middle.

## Hoping to add some music that you can listen to that will sound like this.

Fay Wray

My first band in 1985 - innocence and chorus

Bandit Queen

3 piece family

### This isn't as easy as it could be?

When do I have time to do anything now?
